### Introduction
The idea is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. The resulting HTML is hosted on RPubs.<br/><br/>

#### Data gathering
Since I'm from Cleveland, OH, I decided to plot all Cuyahoga Valley Metroparks locations on the map. The data was downloaded manually from https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/park-addresses.htm. After cleaning up, it's been uploaded to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxrds/DataScience-JohnsHopkinsUniversity/master/09_DevelopingDataProducts/CLEParks1.csv.

```{r map}
library(leaflet)

dfParks <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxrds/DataScience-JohnsHopkinsUniversity/master/09_DevelopingDataProducts/CLEParks1.csv")

my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
my_map <- addMarkers(my_map, lat=dfParks$Park.Lat, lng=dfParks$Park.Lng, 
                     popup=paste(dfParks$Park.Name, dfParks$Park.Address))

my_map
```
